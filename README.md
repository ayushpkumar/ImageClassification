# ImageClassification
The dataset used is from Kaggle ( Originally Presented in AnalyticsVidya competition ) comprises of around 25K images. The Repository aims to classify them in classes using Deep Learning and Machine Learning


# Feature Extraction
The features for SVM Model was extracted using HOG( Histogram of Oriented Gradient ) Features.

# SVM
The model was trained to achieve 77% accuracy for predicting the classes of the images

# CNN
The Deep Learning was used for classification using CNN. The model was trained with 13 layers to achieve the Prediction Accuracy of 83%
